# softwareEngineeringRepo

You may be wondering why there are only a few commits on this repository. 

That's because I was a bit of an idiot around iteration 4 and screwed up my repository and decided to redo the project on my local machine.
I then forgot that I was doing everything locally as I finished the semester, so I added the final result last minute in a single commit.

My bad.
